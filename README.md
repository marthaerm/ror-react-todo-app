# README

This project is a simple ToDo app created based on this [tutorial](https://pamit.medium.com/todo-list-building-a-react-app-with-rails-api-7a3027907665).

The same version of the app was done with Rails and React as separated projects, you can see the source code [here](https://github.com/marthaerm/ror-react-todo-app).
